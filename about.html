          <p>
            I am a student at Stanford University studying Computer Science with
            a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction. I have spent my time
            at Stanford focusing on design, software engineering,
            entrepreneurship, and society in order to leverage my passion for
            human happiness and helping others. In the future, I want to use the
            skills and techniques that I have learned to design better societies
            and happier lives for people.
